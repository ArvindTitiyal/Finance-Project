# Finance-Project

In this data project we will focus on exploratory data analysis of stock prices. Keep in mind, this project is just meant to practice your visualization and pandas skills, it is not meant to be a robust financial analysis or be taken as financial advice.

** NOTE: This project is extremely challenging because it will introduce a lot of new concepts and have you looking things up on your own (we'll point you in the right direction) to try to solve the tasks issued. Feel free to just go through the solutions lecture notebook and video as a "walkthrough" project if you don't want to have to look things up yourself. You'll still learn a lot that way! **

We'll focus on bank stocks and see how they progressed throughout the [financial crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%9308) all the way to early 2016.
